I am confirming.
See you, Mike and Sarah, in my office, then.

So, Mike and Sarah: what time Monday am works for you?

The title co is working on a debit/credit worksheet. I've already reviewed and corrected three of these so far, so hopefully the next one will be very close to the final (the title co calls these "estimated closing statements" so they are meant to be a bit imprecise). 
I expect I'll have the latest one by the end of the day and will forward to everyone for review before our Monday meeting.

Hi -- Monday 11/23 from 8:30am-10am is best for us. 1pm is a bit late since we are 10 hours ahead of you (but possible if necessary).

Is there a spreadsheet that I haven't seen? I see that referenced below. All I have is this one: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uiojQTma6PMxwHqOypR-MH_nyk1Prs5pHtdilg8BUcs/edit#gid=0

Works for us. Morning will be best for Gary and Julia's time zone. Do you mind suggesting a time to all parties?

Monday is fine. Doing this in person allows you to bring me a check for the first installment of my fee ($900). I know you are splitting the total ($2800) 50/50 with the seller, so the final charge to you in escrow will reflect your first payment.

Well done!

Friday might be hard for an in-person; would you be opposed to doing it by phone? Or, could we do Monday morning instead?

Ok, I get it now. Finally! 
The only thing missing from the spreadsheet are all the title fees and tax prorations on the purchase side. I'll work on that with Yvonne.
Do you want to come in Friday for the actual contract signing while we conference with G&J?

Still digesting it all....

Brett,
Here is the breakdown of the purchase in the terms we were thinking (attached).

Brett,
Per our conversation, here are the shared percentages that will be applicable in determining the cost breakdown:
Property Taxes (percentage established through individual purchase prices plus unequal improvements made over time that affected county assessed value)
51.78% by Gary & Julia
48.22% by Mike & Sarah
Fremont Bank Loan Balance
46.36% by Gary & Julia
53.64% by Mike & Sarah
Please let me know any other questions that come up as we understand this is a bit abnormal.

Thanks
Mike
